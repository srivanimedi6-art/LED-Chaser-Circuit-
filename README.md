# 💡 LED Chaser Circuit  

This project demonstrates a simple **LED chaser** (running light) circuit — where LEDs blink one after another in a sequence, creating a moving light effect.  

---

## 🧠 **Project Overview**
The LED chaser is a fun and educational electronics project that helps in understanding **timing circuits, transistor switching, and sequential LED control**.  

---

## ⚙️ **Components Used**
- 6 LEDs  
- Resistors (470Ω or 1kΩ)  
- NPN Transistors (e.g., BC547)  
- Capacitors (10µF or 22µF)  
- Breadboard & connecting wires  
- Power supply (5V or 9V DC)  

---

## 🔍 **Working Principle**
- Transistors are arranged in a feedback loop to turn LEDs ON and OFF one after another.  
- The capacitors and resistors control the timing delay between transitions.  
- The sequence repeats, creating a running-light effect.  

---

## 🧰 **Tools Used**
- Volt Simulator / TinkerCAD  
- Breadboard circuit design  

---

## 🎯 **Learning Outcome**
- Basics of transistor switching  
- Understanding of RC time delay  
- Sequential LED operation logic
